# Ctex Token (CTEX)

The CTEX token is the native currency of the Ctex blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## CTEX utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Ctex blockchain, CTEX is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Ctex to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100k. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.ctexscan.com/](https://status.ctexscan.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked CTEX. Which means validators with higher amounts of Ctex staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any CTEX holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of CTEX they wish. They receive a share of the Ctex block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As CTEX is the native currency on Ctex, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, CTEX transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of CTEX tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Ctex platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
