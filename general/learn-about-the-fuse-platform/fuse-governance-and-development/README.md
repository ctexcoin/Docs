# Ctex Governance and Development

Ctex is already a significantly decentralized platform and plans are in motion to achieve full community control over it in the future. Its governance is currently split among the following actors:

1\) **Network Validators.** Ctex validators are entrusted with deciding whether to adopt [Ctex improvement proposals](https://docs.ctexscan.com/general/fips) (FIPs).  Currently, every validator has one vote regardless of their share of the overall network stake but this is likely to change soon.

2\) **Ctex Foundation and the project team**. Like most public blockchain projects at the initial stage of development, the development of the core network protocol and the Ctex treasury that mostly consists of the undistributed genesis CTEX supply (see the subsection "[CTEX Supply and Current Distribution](https://docs.ctexscan.com/general/fuse-token/fuse-supply-and-current-distribution)") are currently mostly managed by a foundation. For Ctex, this role is played by Gibraltar-incorporated company Ctex Limited.

Ctex Foundation **employs the Ctex project team** whose members' profiles can be found [here](https://ctexscan.com/about).

The project team implements network protocol updates adopted by the validators, other protocol changes that do not require validator votes, maintains the full node software. It develops the mobile-centric infrastructure for creating and managing token communities on Ctex. It also works on boosting the adoption of the network through improving the Ctex tech stack, securing new partnerships and integrations, onboarding ecosystem projects and marketing the platform within the crypto space and beyond.

That said, since Ctex is a decentralized public blockchain platform, **no permission of the project team is required** for anyone who wishes to integrate with or develop on top of Ctex, including the development of the network and node software.

3\) **Ctex Assembly.** See the Assembly [page](https://docs.ctexscan.com/general/fuse-governance/fuse-assembly) for more details.  &#x20;
